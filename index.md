## Welcome to Relay Around Hawaii

This is a cooperative running community where every mile you log moves your team's marker on a route along the Big Island.

Starting October 2020, this is the preview edition. Everyone is part of one big team to complete the 431 mile course.
Teams and Individual participation will launch in 2021.

### Route and Locations

As you record miles, the team marker moves around Hawaii. A gold marker marks the most recent stop. ge 
Green marks previous stops, and Grey stops are those the team has yet to reach.

Check out a description of each stop as the team moves around the course!
