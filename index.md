## Welcome to Relay Around Hawaii

This is a cooperative running community where every mile you log moves your team's marker on a route along the Big Island.

The co-op race starts November 2020. Everyone is part of one big team to complete the 431 mile course. <br/>
A participant may log up to 50 miles towards the overall goal. 
Teams and Individual participation will launch in 2021.

### Route and Locations

{% include progress_map.html %}

As you record miles, the team marker moves around Hawaii. A gold marker marks the most recent stop. <br/>
Green marks previous stops, and Grey stops are those the team has yet to reach.

Check out a description of each stop as the team moves around the course!
